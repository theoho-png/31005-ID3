This package contains the code for an ID3 Decision Tree and its testing files.
The package uses iris and breast cancer dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/).
To run this package, run the assessment.py.
1. The file will generate the accuracy of the model in a 80 to 20 split.
2. The file will determind  the best split, and generate the accuracy of that split.  
3. The file will generate the accuracy after handling missing data
4. The file will determind the optimal tree depth
5. At last, it will combine all the settings and generate its accuracy
